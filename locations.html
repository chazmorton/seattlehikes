            <p class="paragraph-spacing-locations"> Located 40 minutes east of Seattle, the Little Si hike is a great hike for the family. 
                It has an elevation of 1,576 feet (480 m) and lies on the western margin of the Cascade 
                Range just east of the town of North Bend. Little and Big Si were named after local homesteader 
                Josiah "Uncle Si" Merritt. Little Si is a distinct mountain peak from Mount Si, with a different 
                trailhead and a valley that separates the two peaks. The Little Si trailhead is at approximately 
                47°29′14″N 121°45′12″W. Little Si is also known for its rock climbing and bouldering. </p>

                <h1>Snow Lake Hike</h1>
                <h3>King County, WA</h3>
            </div>
            <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/521e4ad0e4b0f54b00dd1c50/58ae1f45e3df28447c8b1097/55760e70e4b0cc538c37e075/1487871558280/?format=1500w" height="400" width="1000">
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph-spacing-locations"> Snow Lake is also a tempting destination in winter, but the steep 
                terrain in the first part of the trail puts visitors at high avalanche risk when snow is present. You 
                should have proper gear and an understanding of how to read the snowpack before venturing out on this trail. 
                The trail departs from the north end of the main parking lot of the Alpental Ski Area, which on any given 
                Saturday or Sunday will fill to capacity. Go early or prepare to be friendly! After an initial 200-foot climb 
                up log steps, the trail settles down for a gradual ascent in forest. A mile in, a talus slope offers a break 
                in the trees and views of a landscape that has suddenly grown exponentially more rugged than the parking lot 
                you just left. In the distance, Chair Peak stands tall at the end of a jagged ridge rising over the far side 
                of the valley.
